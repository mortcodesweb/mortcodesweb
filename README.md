## About
So basically I'm a ex-Minecraft JAPPA-like mod artist that decided to code a OS (Because grown ass adults in their 30-40s decided to bully me viciously into quitting the game for not speaking English well) and does a pretty good job at it.

Thank you bullies, now I have a life and a real career unlike you. Hope Java gets you guys anywhere since nobody uses Java except Android app developers and all will you do is write android app bootstraps. Not the app. Me tho. I code the platform.

Good luck with your half ass mods and oily piss-like JAPPA wannabe textures. Advice from me. JAPPA textures are balance of rough and flat, not oily smooth.

This whole Minecraft community has betrayed me and treated me like garbage numerous times that I lost track so I delivered a giant "fuck you" gift to them with Orchid :D
