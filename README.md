## About
So basically I'm a ex-Minecraft JAPPA-like mod artist that decided to code a OS (Because grown ass adults in their 30-40s decided to bully me viciously into quitting the game for not speaking English well) and does a pretty good job at it.

# BEWARE: Blurryface is EMQSA Grupo
Yes. The same dude who faked a long friendship, worried me for entertainment, asked for Orchid user data keys, defended bullying, scammed people, tried to use me as a scapegoat to scam by attaching his scam with Orchid, tricked me into free labour aaand doxxed me when i got COVID-19 and couldn't help him (Mihaisirius moment), tried to lie and make up shit on the spot to justify doxxing me, says the n-word non-hesitently, hides IP grabbers in his own website, and always hides behind "youre homophobic" to excuse his shit.

Never change, Asshole. Never change.
